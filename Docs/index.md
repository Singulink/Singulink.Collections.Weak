# Singulink.Collections.Weak

The following collections are included in the package:
- `WeakCollection`: Collection of weakly referenced values that keeps items in an undefined order.
- `WeakList`: Collection of weakly referenced values that maintains relative insertion order.
- `WeakValueDictionary`: Collection of keys and weakly referenced values.
